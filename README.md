# TODO:
- Use 'prettier' to format the code?
- Charts:
	- Black background?
	- Add labels and gradation marks to the axes
	- Colours? Green for an overall increase within the time interval,
	and red for a decrease?
	- Use this to build a full-screen Markets Dashboard app that can display
	the current market state of "all of the assets in which we are interested"
	(9? 12? 16? 20? assets)
	- This app can have a slide-out panel that slides out from the right edge
	of the app window when one of the little graphs is clicked; the panel will show the same data, but as a much larger view.
